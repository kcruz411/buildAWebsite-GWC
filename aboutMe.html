	Identity is defined as distinguished characteristics that an individual possesses. One does not acquire these traits right away. Instead, they slowly develop their identity through new experiences and opportunities in their life. So, what defines my identity? I am a golfer, volunteer, and coder. Although all these different topics seem unrelated, they all tie in together to make my unique self.

      I remember on my seventh birthday, I was given a small set of golf clubs, and despite my absolute disappointment at the time, it turns out it would be one of the best presents to be given to me. My parents put me in lessons straight away, and golf quickly became one of my favorite sports. Fast forward to freshman year of high school, I tried out for the GBN golf team and made some of the most amazing friends there. With a majority of the golf team, I am able to share my passion for music with them.

  Additionally, I am very passionate about gender equality and closing the gender gap in STEM. A movie that I feel really defines who I am is “Conceiving Ada”. This film is about Ada Lovelace, one of the first women in technology. Despite society’s expectation of women back then, she broke the rules and allowed her knowledge to lead her. I think that I, too, let my passion for a subject or idea lead my actions. Ada Lovelace is also a huge inspiration for many women in tech now; I completely support the idea that the gender gap in STEM should be fixed through inspiring and educating women. Because of my determination to help this cause, I spend a lot of my free time volunteering at nonprofit organizations who have the goal of educating young girls who don’t have as many resources. Furthermore, I have decided to start the Girls Who Code club at my school in order to welcome more inspired women in the sisterhood. In Northbrook, the subject of a high level of education is pushed in both schools and at homes. I feel if I could take that mindset and encouraged other women in the community to pursue their passion in the STEM field, it could be the start to a huge difference in the gender gap.

  Finally, coding has been an aspect of my life that I have only recently become aware of. A few summers ago, I joined a coding class held at Northwestern and quickly fell in love with the different mindset, quick results, and problem solving involved in computer science. Ever since then, computer science has always been a main interest of mine. Last summer, I enrolled in a coding summer camp called Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program where I was given a mentor and learned the fundamentals of coding. Each week we learned a new language and created small projects. Coding absolutely interests me, and I hope to incorporate it into my life or career in the future. Throughout high school, I have been given the opportunity to enroll in engineering, computer science, and advanced levels of math classes to expand my knowledge in the STEM field. Currently, I am considering majoring in Computer Science since I have recently learned there are many technological options. I believe the world is evolving quickly due to innovations to technology, and the easiest way to keep up is by being part of the creation.
